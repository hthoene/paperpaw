//! Fonts from the internet: a catalog of fonts (paperpaw.org's by
//! default), each name shown in its own font; one is shown larger with a
//! sentence in it, downloaded as a data plugin and read with at once.
//!
//! Nothing of a font is built in: devices that draw scalable fonts get
//! its font files, the others (the X4) font packs made for them, read a
//! glyph at a time from the storage. *More fonts* is offered where the
//! reading font and the status lines' font are chosen, and *Your own
//! fonts*, which shows how to read with a font file of one's own.
